Solutions to the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course projects. The course guides you through making a computer from just NAND gates, letting you build each level of abstraction by hand from the previous level. Hardware projects are done in [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).
