# nand2tetris
Solutions to the [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org) course projects. The course guides you through making a computer from just NAND gates, letting you build each level of abstraction by hand from the previous level. Hardware projects are done in [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).

## Projects
1. Create basic and 16 bit logic gates from NAND gates.
2. Create an ALU and other arithmetic gates from logic gates.
3. Create registers and RAM from DFF (DFF can be built from NAND but this is skipped in the course).
